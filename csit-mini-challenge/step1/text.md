Your journey begins with the first task: Getting the first Pod to run.

This Pod represents your initial investigation unit, gathering vital evidence from the crime scene. As you deploy this Pod, ensure that it is configured correctly and operational.

Successfully launching this Pod will reveal the weapon used in the crime as well as a fingerprint left behind, crucial pieces of evidence that sets the stage for further investigation.
